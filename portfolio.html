                    Digital Art has been one of my biggest hobbies since middle school! I specialize in landscape painting, and would like to showcase a few of my best pieces! For my AP art portfolio, I focused on studying the way light reflects colors through glass or water, and it allowed me to use my imagination fo the fullest. I appreciate art for being such a big part of my life, and I am more than excited to share my passion with the world!
