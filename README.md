## Hi everyone! 🌷

I'm Sophie, and I'm a software engineer currently in the bay area.

I just graduated from UCSC (go slugs! 🐌) with a degree in computer science.

I mainly experiment with web dev in my free time, from Figma designs to developing with react, typescript, tailwind. I've dabbled in game dev with Unity and C# as well.

I am currently learning iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI

🎨 In my spare time, I love art of all mediums. Too many creative hobbies to keep track of, so you can see a showcase of all of them here.
